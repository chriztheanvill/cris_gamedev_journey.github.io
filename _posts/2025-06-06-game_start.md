# Hi, I'm Cris ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software developer.

## ðŸ”§ Current Focus Areas

- **C++ Development**
  - Modern C++ (C++17/23 features)
  - CMake build systems
  - Conan2 package management

- **Game Development Tools**
  - SDL2 for multimedia
  - Profiling and optimization
  - Memory management (Valgrind, etc.)
  - CLion IDE workflows

- **Game Development**
  - Engine architecture
  - From ECS to DOD (Data Oriented Design) patterns
  - Godot engine integration
  - Switching from Godot to Unity

## ðŸš€ Active Projects

### 1. [DOD Engine in C++](https://github.com/chriztheanvill/SDL2_Engine)

- [git source](https://github.com/chriztheanvill/SDL2_Engine/tree/0.0.8-alt)
- [page](/cris_gamedev_journey.github.io/posts/engine_ecs/)

Developing a custom Data Oriented Design game engine from scratch using modern C++.

**Recent Progress:**
- Implemented basic entity management
- Working on memory-efficient component storage
- Integrating SDL2 for initial rendering

### 2. Zig + Raylib or Kotlin + libgdx

> I found challenger and fun unsing Zig or Kotlin. So, I will try them.

### 3. Godot Game Project (Cancelled)

- [page](/cris_gamedev_journey.github.io/posts/godot_game_cpp)

Creating a 2D game using Godot Engine with C++ modules for performance-critical parts.

**Recent Progress:**
- Prototyping core gameplay mechanics
- Developing custom C++ modules for Godot
- Optimizing performance bottlenecks

## Development Tools Stack

- **Primary Language:** C++23
- **Build System:** CMake
- **Package Manager:** Conan2
- **IDE:** CLion
- **Graphics:** SDL2
- **Profiling:** Valgrind, gperftools
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

## Recent Learnings

- Optimizing ECS memory layouts for cache efficiency
- Switching from ECS to DOD, for an excellent Performance
- Integrating Conan packages with CMake
- Godot C++ module compilation workflows
- Find out Zig and Kotlin really fun.
