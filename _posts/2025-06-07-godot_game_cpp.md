# C++26-Powered 2D RPG (Godot Engine)  
*A Souls-like / Bullet-Hell Hybrid with Fallout-Inspired RPG Systems*

This project represents an ambitious blend of modern C++ development practices and game design innovation. Built using **Godot Engine** and deeply integrated with **C++26**, it showcases how cutting-edge language features can enhance performance, maintainability, and expressiveness in real-time applications like games.

---

## üîß Development Stack

- **Language**: Modern C++26 (with `-fno-rtti` for binary optimization)
- **Build System**: CMake + Conan2 for dependency management
- **IDE**: CLion
- **Graphics & UI**: SDL2, Godot Engine (for rendering and GUI)
- **Tools**: Valgrind, Profiling tools, Precompiled Headers (via CMake), SQLite

## üöÄ Recent Advancements

### Performance Improvements
We've achieved a **massive boost in runtime efficiency** thanks to:
- Heavy use of `std::ranges` and `std::views` for zero-copy data processing.
- Functional-style composition over imperative loops.
- Removal of RTTI (`-fno-rtti`) to reduce binary size and improve load times.
- Use of precompiled headers via CMake for faster compilation cycles.

### Architectural Enhancements
- **Event Bus System**: Implemented a lightweight event bus using `std::function` and lambdas for decoupled communication between subsystems (e.g., GUI ‚Üî combat logic).
- **Functional Paradigm**: Leveraging higher-order functions and lambda expressions to simplify complex state transitions and callbacks.
- **Monads in Practice**: Introduced monadic structures for optional chaining (e.g., safe item usage, stat checks) inspired by functional programming patterns.

### Data Handling & Persistence
- **SQLite Integration**: Used SQLite not only for saving player progression but also for dynamic queries such as tracking "most used weapon" or crafting stats.
- Optimized transaction batching for fast saves during high-intensity gameplay moments.

## üì¶ Core Technologies in Depth

### C++26 Highlights
- **`std::ranges` / `std::views`**: For efficient, readable filtering and transformations on enemy groups or inventory items.
- **`std::function` & Lambdas**: As the backbone of event-driven systems (GUI events, AI behaviors).
- **Compile-Time Optimization**: With Conan2 and CMake, we‚Äôve streamlined build pipelines and ensured reproducibility.

### Design Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: For interchangeable item effects and enemy behaviors.
- **Finite State Machines (FSM)**: Managing entity states (Player, Enemy, Prop interactions).
- **Singleton Pattern**: For globally accessible managers like PlayerStats and Inventory.

## üß™ Challenges Overcome

1. **Adapting Godot‚Äôs Node Hierarchy to C++26 Functional Paradigms**  
   Bridging the gap between Godot's object-oriented node tree and idiomatic C++ required careful abstraction layers and smart pointer management.

2. **Optimizing SQLite Transactions**  
   Ensured smooth performance during combat by implementing batched writes and transaction pooling.

3. **Cross-Engine Integration**  
   Maintaining clean separation between Godot-based rendering/UI and C++26 core logic has been critical to long-term scalability.

## üß© Looking Ahead

- More advanced AI using behavior trees powered by functional combinators
- Multiplayer support exploration
- Shader-based VFX enhancements using SDL2 and OpenGL interop
